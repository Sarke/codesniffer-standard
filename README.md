# GiantRobot PHP CodeSniffer Standard
A coding style based on [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) with Allman style braces in control structures.

The resulting style rules for control structures are as follows:

- There MUST be one space after the control structure keyword
- There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis
- There MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis
- The opening brace MUST be on the next line after the closing parenthesis
- The structure body MUST be indented once
- The closing brace MUST be on the next line after the body
